SAP for clinical trials

One of the primary roles of a biostatistician is to write and review SAPs and contribute to statistical analysis. In this brief document, I will attempt to go through the key steps required to write a suitable SAP:


1. INTRODUCTION

2. DATA SOURCE
In this section, describe the data sets to be analyzed.


3. ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES
Briefly state the overall scientific objectives of the analyses, including the key
unanswered questions that these analyses are designed to address. If necessary,
provide additional detail to formulate the objectives in statistical terms. Include a
brief summary of how each objective will be addressed in the analyses.


4. ANALYSIS SETS/ POPULATIONS/SUBGROUPS
Include a brief definition of analysis sets/populations to be used including criteria
for inclusion/exclusion for the population.
Subgroups/subsets should be clearly defined and related back to the objectives
stated above.


5. ENDPOINTS AND COVARIATES
Provide a brief definition of each type of endpoint, if different from those defined
in the original protocol(s), indicating any use of visit windows and definition of
baseline, as appropriate. In general, an endpoint should be defined by both a
variable and a time point (eg, HIV-RNA viral load, change from baseline to week
24). If covariates are to be included in the statistical analyses, provide brief
definitions/derivation rules.


6. HANDLING OF MISSING VALUES AND OTHER DATA CONVENTIONS
Describe how missing values will be handled in the statistical analyses, and
justify the methods used.

7. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY

- Statistical procedures
- Measures to adjust for multiplicity, confounder, heterogeneity, etc.

8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
If any sensitivity analyses are planned, using for example different analysis sets,
covariates, methods/models etc, then these analyses should be described and
briefly justified here.

9. RATIONALE FOR ANY DEVIATION FROM PRE-SPECIFIED ANALYSIS
PLAN PERFORMED BY PFIZER If these analyses differ from those that were already performed, provide brief rationale for the change in approach.

10. QC PLANS
Provide a brief description of the QC Plan.

11. PROGRAMMING PLANS
Provide algorithms for generating tables and results to be executed by a Statistician.
