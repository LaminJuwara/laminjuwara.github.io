I am a Postdoc researcher in data science and privacy at CHEO Research Institute. I completed my PhD in the [Quantitative Life Sciences Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/) at McGill University where I specialized in Computational Statistics and its applications to the life sciences. I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/)(Biostatistics) and [Prof Archer Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/)(Statistics). My research interest generally lies in developing new statistical and computational methods for analyzing biomedical data in distributed networks without disclosing sensitive information.
