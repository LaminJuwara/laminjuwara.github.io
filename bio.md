I am a Senior Applied Scientist in Health Data Science at the Government of Manitoba. I lead the portfolio on health and social services. Before joining the civil service, I was a postdoctoral researcher in data science and privacy at the CHEO Research Institute under the mentorship of Prof. Khaled El Emam.  

My research interests focus on developing statistical and computational methods for analyzing biomedical data in distributed networks while preserving data privacy.  

I completed my PhD at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/), where my doctoral research centered on privacy-preserving regression methods for distributed biomedical data. I had the privilege of being co-advised by [Dr. Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/) (Biostatistics) and [Prof. Archer Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/) (Statistics).
