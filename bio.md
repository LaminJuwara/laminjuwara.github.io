I am a researcher in data science and privacy at CHEO. I completed my PhD in Computational Statistics and Data Privacy in the [Quantitative Life Sciences Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/) at McGill University. I was co-advised by [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/) and [Prof Archer Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/). My research interest generally lies in developing new statistical and computational methods for analyzing distributed biomedical data without disclosing sensitive personal information. I also frequently collaborate with the [Schipper Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hyman_Schipper) on applied projects to identify and validate salivary biomarkers for various neurodegenerative disease.
