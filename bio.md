I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Life Sciences at McGill. Iâ€™m co-advised by Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri, Prof Yi Yang, and Dr Ana Velly. The focus of my research is Privacy-preserving data publication for centralized analysis.


My MSc training was in Biostatistic (also) under the supervisions of  [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/) and [Dr Alexandra M Schmidt](http://alex-schmidt.research.mcgill.ca/) working on privacy preserving data analysis. Prior to mcgill, I studied at [AIMS](https://www.aims.ac.za/en/home)- Stellenbosch University (MSc Mathematics) and worked under the supervision of [Dr Wilfred Ndifon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7leliwAAAAJ&hl=en).
