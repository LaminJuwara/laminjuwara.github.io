## <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Life Sciences at McGill. My MSc training was on privacy preserving data analysis at the department of Biostatistics under the supervisions of  [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/) and [Dr Alexandra M Schmidt](http://alex-schmidt.research.mcgill.ca/). Prior to mcgill, I studied at [AIMS](https://www.aims.ac.za/en/home)- Stellenbosch University (MSc Mathematics) under the supervision of [Dr Wilfred Ndifon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7leliwAAAAJ&hl=en) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Tech, Ghana (BSc Mathematics). I am from The Gambia and have lived ~~and studied~~ there until 2007.
