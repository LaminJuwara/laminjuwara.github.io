## <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in [Quantitative Life Sciences](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/) at McGill. I'm co-advised by [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/), [Prof Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/), and [Dr Ana Velly](https://www.mcgill.ca/dentistry/ana-miriam-velly). The focus of my research is Privacy-preserving data disclosure and analysis of biomedical data. I'm also a member of the [Schipper Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hyman_Schipper) working on projects related to salivary biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. 

My MSc training was at the department of Biostatistics under [Dr Paramita Saha-Chaudhuri](https://sites.google.com/site/paramitasaharesearch/) and [Dr Alexandra M Schmidt](http://alex-schmidt.research.mcgill.ca/). Prior to mcgill, I studied at [AIMS](https://www.aims.ac.za/en/home)- [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english) (MSc Mathematics) under the supervision of [Dr Wilfred Ndifon](https://ndifongroup.org/) and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Tech, Ghana (BSc Mathematics). I am from The Gambia and have lived there until 2007.
