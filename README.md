# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website.

This site serves as a central hub for my academic and professional work in health data science, statistical modeling, and privacy-preserving methods for biomedical data. It includes:

- A short biography and current position
- Updates on recent news, publications, and projects
- A curated list of selected publications
- Research interests and ongoing work
- Links to software, R packages, and web tools I have developed
- Access to my GitHub repositories and Google Scholar profile

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
